# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

As part of the analysis of PyBer ride-sharing data, we have been tasked with creating a summary dataframe and graph of ride-sharing fare data by city type in order to identify disparities or opportunities for PyBer.

## Results

It is immediately apparent from the line chart of total fare by city type that urban rides bring in a greater fare amount every week than suburban rides, which in turn bring in greater fares than rural.

However, this is attributable to the number of rides per city type. In our data set only 125 rides took place in rural locations, and their average fares were higher. Both the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver are inversely proportional to the population density.

## Summary

Based on the analysis, there seems to be an opportunity to increase the ride share presence in suburban and rural cities. All else being equal PyBer would best increase revenue by focussing development on rural areas instead of urban areas. Possible approaches might include:

* Recruit additional drivers in suburban and rural areas;
* Incentivize rides in rural areas, i.e. discount fares to make PyBer more attractive to customers; or
* Expand offerings to additional suburban and rural cities.
